# Design Approach

The solution was based on the Search Trie data structure, that is an efficient implementation of a symbol table for String as keys. This symbol table implementation is able to find the keys (words) in a sub-linear performance. The idea is to explore this ability to find the word combinations for phone numbers.

Performance: Sub-linear.<br>

Memory Usage: Constant.

Read input from console and use inbuilt dictionary and immediately prints the words found.
